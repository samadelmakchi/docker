### Gitea, GitLab
Using Git repository management software enables teams to collaborate effectively on their projects, track the history of changes, and easily access previous versions of code. These tools facilitate software development processes and allow multiple developers to work simultaneously by providing features such as branching and merging. Additionally, by utilizing CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) systems, the deployment process can be automated, helping to reduce errors and improve code quality. Some of the key software in this area includes GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, and Gogs, each of which has its own unique features and addresses the varying needs of developers.

### Why Should We Use GitLab or Gitea?
Both GitLab and Gitea are popular tools for managing Git repositories, but each has its specific advantages:

- GitLab, with its advanced CI/CD features, project management capabilities, and full DevOps integration, is a powerful platform suitable for large teams and extensive projects. Features like monitoring, issue management, and support for large repositories make GitLab an excellent choice for organizations and complex projects.

- Gitea is a lightweight and simple software that can be installed quickly and consumes minimal system resources. This tool is ideal for small to medium-sized projects and for teams seeking a cost-effective solution with basic features. Gitea is also a perfect choice for those looking to host their code repositories with straightforward setup on personal servers.
